This section demonstrates how to use pyALF through small examples that can be directly executed, if everything has been set up as described in {numref}`sec:pyalf_install`. It first shows on a minimal example how to run an ALF simulation and get some results. Then the different features of pyALF are expanded in more detail. 

```{tableofcontents}

For a reference on all features, see {numref}`sec:pyalf_reference`.

```{tip}
The Python builtin {func}`help` is very useful for getting information on an object. Try e.g. `help(Simulation)` after importing `Simulation` from `py_alf`.
