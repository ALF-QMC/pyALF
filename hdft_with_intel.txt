It really sucks... So HDF5 should be installed and up-to-date (10.4), but pyALF doesn't seem to see it and wants to install it (10.7) again - OK, fine, if it worked I wouldn't care. However:
- Running configure.sh with HDF5 and Intel doesn't work (that type_t error) and running install_hdf5.sh directly crashes the terminal.
- Compilation works with HDF5 and GNU, but ALF won't run, as HDF5 throws errors.
If you also don't know what's going on, I'll open an issue, but I wonder if it's something stupid on my side or my machine only...

ALF is set up to always install and compile HDF5 itself, because HDF5 uses modules and for that the compiler that compiled HDF5 has to fit to the compiler that compiles ALF, so that part is not the problem.

Good.

If you try install_hdf5.sh, it needs some variables. E.g. call it like: 
CC="$CC" FC="$FC" CXX="$CXX" HDF5_DIR="$HDF5_DIR" "$ALF_DIR/HDF5/install_hdf5.sh"

Where 
* CC: C compiler
* FC: Fortran compiler
* CXX: C++ preprocessor (or just a C++ compiler)
* HDF5_DIR: Directory, where HDF5 will be installed.
[3:44 PM]
In configure.sh, HDF5_DIR is:
$FC -o get_compiler_version.out get_compiler_version.F90
compiler_vers=$(./get_compiler_version.out | sed 's/[ ,()]/_/g')
HDF5_DIR="$ALF_DIR/HDF5/$compiler_vers

Ok, so it's like running (install_hdf5.sh) after running configure.sh. I'll try these soon. Thanks.

Same error. In my machine I can't get HDF5 installed with Intel. But Intel compilers are always "nice to have", never necessary, right?

yes
